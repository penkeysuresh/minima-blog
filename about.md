I am Penkey Suresh and this is my personal blog. I am a software developer with complete product life cycle experience in both mobile and web. I know a little about a lot of things. In my career as a software developer, I've coded and deployed applications in Java, AngularJS, Solr, Django, AWS, iOS, Docker and various build tools and techniques. I actively look for new technologies to get my hand on.

This blog is a lot about the things I've implemented during my job, side projects, and a little about my own life and for amusement. The blog posts are a simple hack to get the problem solved instead of in depth explanation of the technologies that are used (documentation does a better job for in depth analysis of technologies)
